# Learning Objectives

- Define what a database is
- Define what a Database Management System (DBMS) is
- Define what data model is
- Define what the Structured Query Language (SQL) is for

---
# What is a Database?

A collection of data organized in a way that can be easily accessed, managed, and updated

---
# Flat Files/Tables

A database can be simple as a collection of flat files

- organized in a file system
- specific programs to access/update

---
# Flat Files/Tables have Disadvantages

- lack of access control/security
- lack of data integrity (did we both update a table at once?)
- lack of quick access to specific data

---
# Database Management Systems (DBMS)

Software that allows for the creation, defintion, and manipulation of data in the database

- accommodates large datasets (storage; querying; indexing)
- ensures data integrity when multiple users are accessing/modifying it at once (concurrency)
- crash recovery, logging
- security and access control

# Relational Data Model

```{r echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("image/er_example.jpg")
```

---
# Structured Query Language

- Used to create, modify, and query tables in a relational database
- Verbs
  - `SELECT`, `CREATE TABLE`, `INNER JOIN`
- Modifiers
  - `FROM`, `WHERE`, `LIKE`
- Criteria
  - `Year > 2005`
- A sequence of SQL commands is called a *query*

# Structured Query Language example

```{r echo=FALSE}
